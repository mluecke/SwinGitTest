                <text type="warning_summary_footer">Details of warnings are available on the Bureau's website www.bom.gov.au, by telephone 1300-659-218* or through some TV and radio broadcasts.</text>
                <text type="synoptic_situation">A deep low pressure system off the South Coast is moving east, while a high in the Bight remains slow moving. Strong west to southwesterly winds in the airstream between these two systems will gradually ease during Thursday as the low weakens and moves southeast. Winds will become light under the dominating ridge on Friday, then turn north to northwesterly and strengthen on Saturday ahead of an approaching cold front. The front is expected to bring south to southwesterly change to New South Wales coast during late Saturday and Sunday.</text>
